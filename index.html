		One thing I enjoy so far about participating in LC101 Kansas City is meeting so many interesting people with diverse backgrounds and passions.  Each person has their reason(s) for pursuing a programming education and career.  My "why" is really a journey I've taken over the past six years.  It's a journey that has crossed several states (and career paths).  It's a journey that's truly unique.

		<p>
		It was December of 2010, I was 20 years old, and I had no idea what I would be when I grew up.  I was working on my associates degree with no real major in mind.  My high school aspiration was to be a full-time actor, but that dream had long since died.  My parents had moved from our home in Florida to Little Rock, Arkansas in September 2010 because my dad was starting a new job at FIS, a financial solutions provider and IT outsourcer. 
		</p>
		<p>
		When class dismissed for winter break in December, I visited them in Little Rock for the first time and liked the area.  My parents told me that FIS was offering entry-level positions for their inbound call center.  That, and a few other details which would make up a story in itself, led me to quit school, move to Arkansas with my folks and apply for work at FIS.
		</p>
		<p>
		You need to understand something about me at this point.  I hate spending a bunch of time in front of a screen and always have.  When I interviewed for a position at the call center, I knew how to check my emails and type.  That was apparently enough to land a job and I started at FIS in April of 2011.  The call center was a fast-paced, learn-on-the-go environment.  I wasn't required to have much technical know-how; it required people skills more than anything.  I soon became proficient and was even tasked with training new-hires.
		</p>
		<p>
		Unfortunately, the call center shut down and moved a year later.  When I heard of the impending layoffs, I was at a loss as to where I'd go next.  Just a few weeks before our last day however, emails circulated about a new department opening up that needed some talent.  I, like many others, jumped at the opportunity and was thankfully hired on.
		</p>
		<p>
		This new department was the CCSC - Customer Care Support Center.  It was a technical helpdesk for a particular software offering our company supported.  Customers would call in to report bugs or outages and our team would open tickets and engage relevant support staff.  Here is where I had my first look at a UNIX command line, before I even knew what UNIX was.  Besides knowing the ticketing system and a few basic CLI commands, not much more was required of me than what I learned in the call center.  But I learned a great deal about IT from opening problem tickets and speaking regularly with database administrators, application support, account managers and other experienced technicians.  I got a bird's eye view of "how things work".
		</p>
		<p>
		After a year in the CCSC, I was browsing internal job postings and came upon a listing for "entry-level Systems Programmer".  Reading the posting, I didn't understand the requirements at all but thought, 'Hey, entry-level... couldn't hurt to apply.'  So I did and got an interview!  When I told my parents, my dad was really excited for me.  "You've got an interview with Bruce (my current boss)?  That is a great organization!"  I learned from him that Bruce's group did something on "the mainframe", whatever that was.  My dad happened to work in mainframe operations, so he sent me a few things to read before the interview.
		</p>
		<p>
		I met with Bruce and discovered they were looking for entry-level employees who could learn from the more experienced mainframe system programmers.  He asked me about my technical experience and I told him about my little knowledge of the UNIX command line.  That seemed to be enough and two interviews later, I got the job!
		</p>
		<p>
		Long story short, I had no idea what I was getting into; I was doing well to spell "mainframe".  So the first week of on-the-job training was a fire hose of information.  I literally had to take a nap once I got home from my first day on the new job.  Our team manages a piece of middleware that allows the mainframe to send and receive application data to/from other platforms.  It was in this new position that I began to have an interest in the nuts and bolts of computer science, programming, networking, and other aspects of IT.  I would spend nearly entire shifts reading documentation and internet forums, trying to get a grip on how to do my job well.
        </p>
        <p>
		I've been in this current position for three years and I love it.  During that time, my interest in application development has grown.  My coworkers come from a development background and we work with developers every day.  Even though application development isn't the focus of my job, I believe that the ability to "speak the language" helps my fellow system programmers in their daily tasks.  Since I had no formal education beyond gen-ed college courses and on-the-job training, I began searching for a program that would help me build skills in application development.  That search (and a family move from Little Rock to Kansas City) led me to LC101.
		</p>
		<p>
		When I look back on my journey of education and career development, I'm surprised to be working in IT at all.  It was never what I set out to do.  But I have grown to love what I do and I seek to daily improve my skills in order to do the best work possible.  It's this desire that drives me to learn LC101's course material and excites me to see what lies ahead.
